  <p>Due to the discontinuing support of Adobe Flash most content has been removed and it is pretty empty right now :(. But I plan on adding to it soon. Next version will hopefully be up by September. This is an update</p>

  <h1>Commentary on https://utahavalanchecenter.org/avalanche/85726</h1>
  <p>
    Dr Samuel Snow praises the skiiers good judgement in shreding this slope later in the day, as opposed to early in the morning. Had the skiiers attempted this early in the morning, the suns rays wouldn't have strengthened the snowpack yet, and would have increased the avalance size.

    As the diurnal cycle progresses, the solar angle increases, thereby augmenting the efficiency of solar radiation absorption by the snowpack. This heightened absorption facilitates a process of structural metamorphosis within the snow crystals, leading to a phenomenon known as diurnal metamorphism. During the late morning and early afternoon hours, the gradual increase in temperature promotes the sintering of individual snow grains, fostering a cohesive bond between them. This enhanced cohesion results in a more stable snowpack, effectively reducing the likelihood of slab avalanches triggered by skier activity. Furthermore, the consolidation of the snowpack engenders a smoother skiing surface, characterized by reduced surface roughness and enhanced glideability, thus optimizing the overall skiing experience. Consequently, skiing later in the day not only mitigates the inherent risks associated with avalanche hazards but also ensures optimal skiing conditions conducive to heightened performance and enjoyment.
